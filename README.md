# SQLDataModeler
JavaScript scripts for Oracle SQL Data Modeler's custom design rules and custom transformation. Additionally, there are custom reports for SQL Developer available.
Please, fell free to send your comments on these scripts, as well as suggestions to new ones.

Please, note that thare are some scripts in this repository that are shipped with Oracle SQL Data Moduler.</br> 
Here is the list of new sripts that I created:
# Custom Design Rules:
- FK without index
- Index with invalid name
- Tables without primary key
- Tables without volume properties
- Tables with invalid tablespace assignment
- Sequences with NOCACHE

# Custom Transformation Scripts:
- Create index on FK
- Normalize index name
- Adjuste table, index and lob storage properties

# Custom Reports for SQL Developer
- Foreign Keys without index
- Schema Diff (based on Jeffrey M. Hunter website; and adapted to work with SQL Developer)
